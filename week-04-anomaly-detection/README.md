# Week 4: Anomaly Detection & Log Analytics

> **Theme:** Detecting the unknown unknowns in your systems

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

1. Implement statistical anomaly detection (Z-score, IQR, EWMA)
2. Build ML-based anomaly detectors (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders)
3. Perform log pattern mining with Drain3
4. Create real-time anomaly detection pipelines

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Anomaly Detection Methods
```
Statistical           ML-Based              Deep Learning
──────────           ────────              ─────────────
• Z-score            • Isolation Forest    • Autoencoders
• IQR                • One-Class SVM       • LSTM
• EWMA               • LOF                 • Transformers
• Seasonal decomp    • DBSCAN              • VAE
```

### Log Analytics Pipeline
```
Raw Logs → Parsing (Drain3) → Clustering → Pattern Mining → Anomaly Detection
```
