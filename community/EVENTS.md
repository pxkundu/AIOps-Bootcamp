# Community Events & Engagement

> **Connecting the dots between learning and industry experts.**

Events bring the static documentation to life. We use events to showcase work, bring in expert voices, and solve complex problems in real-time.

## 🗓️ Event Types

### 1. Weekly "Pulse" Check-ins (Virtual)
*   **When:** Every Monday (Week Start)
*   **Goal:** Walk through the objectives for the upcoming week and answer "blocker" questions from the previous week.

### 2. Expert Masterclasses
*   **When:** Bi-weekly
*   **Goal:** Industry engineers from companies like AWS, Google, or Datadog share deep dives into specific modules (e.g., "The math behind Isolation Forest in production").

### 3. Global Demo Day
*   **When:** At the end of Week 8
*   **Goal:** The top capstone projects are presented to the entire community and invited hiring managers.

### 4. Collaborative Bug-Bashes
*   **When:** Ad-hoc
*   **Goal:** When a new lab is released, a "live stream" event to test it out together and fix bugs on the fly.
