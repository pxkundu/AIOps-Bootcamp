# Week 7: Auto-Remediation & Incident Intelligence

> **Theme:** Closing the loop with automated response

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

1. Build automated remediation runbooks with Ansible/Python
2. Integrate LLMs for incident analysis and summarization
3. Create ChatOps bots for operations
4. Implement Kubernetes self-healing patterns

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Remediation Levels
```
Level 0: Manual → Human does everything
Level 1: Assisted → Bot suggests actions
Level 2: Semi-Auto → Bot executes with approval
Level 3: Auto → Bot executes autonomously (safe ops)
```

### LLM for AIOps Use Cases
| Use Case | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| Incident summarization | Summarize logs/alerts |
| RCA suggestions | Analyze patterns |
| Runbook generation | Convert docs to code |
| Natural language queries | "What caused the outage?" |
