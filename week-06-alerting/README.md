# Week 6: Intelligent Alerting & Noise Reduction

> **Theme:** From alert fatigue to actionable insights

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

1. Build alert correlation and deduplication systems
2. Implement topology-aware root cause analysis
3. Replace static thresholds with dynamic ML-based thresholds
4. Create alert severity prediction models

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Alert Correlation Strategies
```
Temporal Correlation    Topological Correlation    Semantic Correlation
───────────────────    ───────────────────────    ────────────────────
Same time window?      Same service/dependency?   Similar message content?
```

### Dynamic Thresholds
```
Static: if cpu > 80% → alert
Dynamic: if cpu > (baseline + 2*std) → alert

Benefits:
- Adapts to traffic patterns
- Reduces false positives  
- Handles seasonality
```
